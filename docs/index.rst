   **Probabilistic Graphical Models** are open-box models which can be easily interpreted by humans. Our research focus on expanding the scope 
   and the possibilities of this models by developing new inference and learning algorithms, and how to enhance their applicability to real world problems.

   **Probabilistic Machine Learning** is a branch of machine learning based on (Bayesian) probability theory. Our research focus on developing new 
   methods to make these methods scalable to deal with massive data sets and data streams as well as applications to real world problems.

   **InferPy** is a high-level API for deep probabilistic modeling written in Python and capable of running on top of Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy's API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible data processing, easy-to-code probablistic modelling and scalable inference.

	**Risk prediction in credit operations** with the AMIDST Toolbox. The problem consisted on predicting wether a client is going to default in one
	of his/her credits during the coming twelve months. Data was collected continuously and reported on a monthly basis, this gives rise to a 
	streaming data classification problem.

	AMIDST Toolbox has been used to prototype models for **early recognition of traffic maneuver intentions**. Similarly to the previous case, data is continuously collected by car on-board sensors giving rise to a large and quickly evolving data stream. This work has been performed in collaboration with one of our partners, DAIMLER.

     **Crime prediction using data mining methods**. This technology transfer project (subject to a "non-disclousure agreement") was also made in collaboration with the company Gobile. Within this project we developed novel data mining methods for predicting the spatio-temporal occurrence of the crimes of a city based on the historical record of crimes. We started from the fact that crimes do not distribute uniformly across the city. They tend to concentrate in some areas and at some time intervals. Police forces used this knowledge when making decisions over the assignment of the scarce resources. However, the application of data mining and machine learning techniques provides a rigorous approach to deal with this information and allows making better-informed predictions and decisions.

     **Sales Force Designing**. This technology transfer project (subject to a "non-disclousure agreement") was made in collaboration with the company Gobile. The project mainly consisted on the design of an artifical based software to address the problems in the design of a sales force.  This problem involves the solution of several interrelated problems:  sizing the sales force,  the problem of finding the appropriate number of salesman;  salesmen location,  the problem of selecting the location of each salesman in one sales coverage unit;  sales territory alignment,  the problem of groupingor clustering sales coverage unit into larger geographical groups; and sales resources allocation, the problem of assigning work hours of the salesman to different sales territories, considering also a broad set of restrictions which are normally associated to it.
