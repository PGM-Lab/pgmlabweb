Why read clickbait over longform journalism? Why use Facebook so much?

Screentime is bad, but the [attention economy](http://www.tristanharris.com/essays/) incentivizes our addiction.

I'm trying to reduce information overload. Here are some methods I've used for a while.

Thoughts on benefits, pitfalls, and other ideas? Hit me up at [j@jaan.io](mailto:j@jaan.io). I’ll keep this updated.

The current list:

* No news except for the Harper’s [Weekly Review](http://harpers.org/blog/category/weekly-review/) every Tuesday.
* Two devices: a ‘work’ laptop and an ‘email/distraction’ device (Macbook Air and iPad).
* On the work laptop, permanently block Gmail and any distracting sites (using [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) with [extended block lengths](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/Tweaking-Max-Block-Length-and-Block-Length-Interval)).
* Looking at [Rescuetime](http://rescuetime.com/) logs every week and updating my SelfControl blacklist with distracting websites.
* No TV, and about five movies per year. If I'm forced to watch movies/TV/other media, watch it at 2x (it's a bit harder to follow at first on these faster speeds; start at 1.5x and work your way up). Ditto for podcasts and lectures: 2x saves a lot of time with little loss in retention.
* Every few months: skimming the top 20 posts of each day on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) using [HckrNews](http://hckrnews.com/). Interesting links go to Instapaper. Doing this in batches helps filter useful things from hype cycle fare.
* Once a year: skim RSS feeds using Feedly, save to Instapaper. I like [Longform](http://longform.org/)’s curation service of high quality long-form journalism and essays.
* Many tricks from ['This is your brain on mobile'](https://medium.com/@jgvandehey/this-is-your-brain-on-mobile-15308056cfae) like no phone notifications and no social media apps.
* Using a pay-as-you-go [phone plan](https://www.ptel.com/plans/pg). Combined with Google Voice, this is cheap and the 10c/MB data keeps me off mobile internet unless necessary (like maps when out).
* On Facebook, systematically unfollowing everyone in the newsfeed (this took an hour of clicking, but was [well worth it](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy)). An empty newsfeed is revelatory: if I'm truly interested in someone, I'll go to their profile page or use the graph search tool.
* Leaving all devices at work as often as possible. Then I’m totally disconnected and forced to read, [be alone](http://chronicle.com/article/The-End-of-Solitude/3708), and [take a real break](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/opinion/sunday/hit-the-reset-button-in-your-brain.html).
* For complete blocking of ambient noise, 3M Peltor [industrial earmuffs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009LI4K/) over in-ear [headphones](http://www.amazon.com/RBH-EP-2-Earphones/dp/B00H7LAJQA) give the most reduction I’ve found in crowded NYC subways.
* Tara Brach’s [guided meditations](http://www.tarabrach.com/audioarchives-guided-meditations.html) and podcasts are awesome for [downtime](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/) and self-therapy during the week.
* Making all desktop backgrounds pictures of your aged face (through an [app](http://faceretirement.merrilledge.com/)). This can add immediacy and help you make better decisions.
* Using [countdown apps](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calendar-and-countdown/caplfhpahpkhhckglldpmdmjclabckhc?hl=en) to keep the number of _days_ to a big deadline visible every day. This can help connect your present self to your future self.

### Benefits and pitfalls

When stuck I'm forced to go to lame sites (the interesting ones like Gmail and Hacker News are blocked). I can’t New Tab away from boredom and have to sit with the discomfort.

I’m getting better staying with this existential fear-of-failure crisis of ‘I’m stuck’. Paying attention to the discomfort helps; eventually it dissipates and interesting ideas appear. But this doesn't happen if I'm constantly checking emails, sites, or phone notifications.

Severely limiting my information intake means I read more and get bored more often. It takes a few days to hear about big news sometimes.

How could information filtering be applied to the physical world? I’d love to see the collections at the Met, MoMA, and other NYC museums, but there is no time. I need a recommendation system for this equivalent to Instapaper or Longform. Museum collections and physical things do not have a ‘save for later’ feature. Adblock for the real world isn't here yet (c.f. augmented reality circa 2020). Meanwhile, can we mentally train to avoid advertising?

If everyone used these weird hacks, no one would make money online and there would be no one to upvote things on Hacker News or Reddit; no one to ‘like’. These techniques might leave me more (or less) susceptible to [filter bubbles](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles), but it’s a fun experiment.

Could recommendation systems be the solution to these issues? Would this accentuate the problem? Is there even a problem, or is this part of the ['busy'](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636612-time-poverty-problem-partly-perception-and-partly-distribution-why) [trap](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/)?
