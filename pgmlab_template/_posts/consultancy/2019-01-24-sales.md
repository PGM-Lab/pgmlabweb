This technology transfer project (subject to a “non-disclousure agreement”) was made in collaboration with the company Gobile. The project mainly consisted on the design of an artifical based software to address the problems in the design of a sales force. This problem involves the solution of several interrelated problems: sizing the sales force, the problem of finding the appropriate number of salesman; salesmen location, the problem of selecting the location of each salesman in one sales coverage unit; sales territory alignment, the problem of groupingor clustering sales coverage unit into larger geographical groups; and sales resources allocation, the problem of assigning work hours of the salesman to different sales territories, considering also a broad set of restrictions which are normally associated to it.
