AMIDST Toolbox has been used to prototype models for early recognition of traffic maneuver intentions. Similarly to the previous case, data is continuously collected by car on-board sensors giving rise to a large and quickly evolving data stream. This work has been performed in collaboration with one of our partners, DAIMLER.
