I took a bunch of pictures and edited them to be cooler than reality. On hiatus to focus on research, music, and people.

Because I release everything uncopyrighted, my photos are *featured* on [extremely](https://thenewtropic.com/tourism-economy-culture/) [random](http://viagemempauta.com.br/2015/11/09/destinos-vistos-do-alto/) [websites](http://www.liligo.co.uk/travel-magazine/a-fall-in-airfare-has-prompted-people-to-travel-more-this-year-21250.html) (including [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/05/how-a-neighborhood-block-can-affect-a-persons-success/483983/), [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/03/09/loblaw-plans-on-opening-5_n_6829712.html), [Matador](https://matadornetwork.com/notebook/11-moments-youll-always-remember-first-cross-country-road-trip/), [Outside Magazine](http://www.outsideonline.com/2060641/our-reliance-technology-makes-backcountry-more-dangerous) and [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/preserving-land-isnt-enough-to-save-the-tropics-1770276264)!).
