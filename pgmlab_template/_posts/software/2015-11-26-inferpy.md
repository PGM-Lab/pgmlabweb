**InferPy** is a high-level API for deep probabilistic modeling written in Python and capable of running on top of Edward and Tensorflow. InferPyâ€™s API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible data processing, easy-to-code probablistic modelling and scalable inference.
